# AccentureCaseStudy

**Background Info:**

- I am a Data Analyst at Accenture that works within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility.
The team has been assigned a new project for a client calledÂ **Social Buzz.**


**Project Brief:**

- Client name: Social Buzz
- Client industry: Social media & content creation
- Year established: 2010
- Location of HQ: San Francisco
- Number of employees: 250
- Client background: Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one from London and the other from San Francisco. They left in 2008 and both met in San Francisco to start their business. They started Social Buzz because they saw an opportunity to build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.
